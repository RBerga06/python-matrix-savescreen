# rberga06-matrix

Terminal screensaver with _Matrix_-like raindrop effect, written in Python.

> **Warning**
> This is _not_ an actual 'screen saver', because it's not trivial to render;
> hence, while this program is in execution, the computer will try and render the effect as fast as possible.
> This might have a negative impact on the system resources (such as RAM or VRAM) in use.
